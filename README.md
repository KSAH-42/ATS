# ATS

This project is actually under construction, there is some project which not contains any classes. Go back to this project in a few days later. 

Thanks.

I create this project in order to explorer a different to build client API.
So here, ATS stands for Automatic Trading Software.

This project represent a client api used to managed banking operations like:

* Open account
* Buy credit card
* Deactivate a credit card 
* Query the transaction
* etc...

I think that the main concept of this project can be resued on others domain.
