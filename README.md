# ATS

This project is actually under construction, there are some projects which doesn't contains any classes. Please, go back to this project few days later.


I create this project in order to explorer a different way to build client API using DDD approach.
So here, ATS stands for Automatic Trading System. 

This project represent a client api used to managed banking operations like:

* Open account
* Buy credit card
* Deactivate a credit card 
* Query the transaction
* Management payment
* etc...

I think that the main concept of this project can be resued on others domain.

Notes:

I don't come from banking world, I choose this domain, because I often ask my self how a bank IT systems works, and especial the device that can deliver bills.
